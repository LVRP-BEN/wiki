## Postman job

If you aspire to become a postman, you're in the right place. This guide will walk you through the process of undertaking this fulfilling role.

### Location

You can find the Post Office on the map, situated in Paleto Bay. Look for the small green truck icon as your landmark.

### Starting The Job

Upon reaching the Post Office, your first task is to collect packages. Access your ALT Menu and select "Get Post To Deliver." Feel free to press this option multiple times until your inventory is full. If you don't have your own van, you can borrow one by selecting "Borrow A Vehicle."

Next, open your inventory and right-click on a package, then choose "Set GPS" to mark the delivery location. Remember to keep track of which package's GPS you've set.

### Delivering

Once you've arrived at the GPS-marked location, and if you're unsure which door to deliver to, you can press "Set GPS" again, and a little red bubble will appear in front of the correct door. Once you've identified the correct door, open your inventory, right-click on the corresponding package, and select "Attempt Delivery." Upon successful delivery, you should receive a notification on your phone confirming payment into your bank account.

### Handling Excess Post

If you find yourself burdened with an excess of undelivered post or simply wish to pursue other endeavors, return to the Post Office. Access your ALT menu and press "Return Undelivered Post." This action will send all remaining post in your inventory back to the Post Office, granting you the freedom to proceed as you wish.

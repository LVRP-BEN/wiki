# Cannabis
Our cannabis cultivation system boasts absolute uniqueness. It involves a series of well-defined steps that you must follow diligently. However, we must emphasize that specific locations will not be disclosed on this page. Nevertheless, we will provide a comprehensive explanation of how the system operates.

## Growing

To cultivate cannabis, you will first need to acquire quality seeds. There is a riddle crafted by the reputable Weed Seed Seller to guide you to his location. Once you locate him, you'll have the opportunity to purchase the seeds.

After obtaining the seeds, proceed to plant them carefully. This can be accomplished by selecting "use" in your inventory or utilizing the 1-5 Inventory hotkeys. The plants will exhibit steady growth, and by holding the ALT key, you can monitor their growth stages.

## Harvesting

Upon reaching full maturity, it's time to harvest the cannabis. Utilize the ALT menu to perform the harvest. There is a grace period of approximately 10 minutes during which only you can collect the yield. After this period, there is a further 30-minute window during which anyone can collect the crop before the plant withers.

## Processing

Once you have gathered all the matured cannabis, it's time to process it discreetly at a concealed location. 

Using the ALT menu, carefully dry the cannabis on a rack. Once the drying process is complete, you can decide whether to create joints or bricks. This marks the final step before you are ready to enter the market.

## Selling

With your product prepared, your next task is to identify suitable buyers. The ALT menu will once again be your ally in this regard, facilitating the selling process in a seamless manner.

Please note that the cultivation and sale of cannabis are subject to applicable laws and regulations...
